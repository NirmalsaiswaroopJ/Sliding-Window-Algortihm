# Sliding-Window-Algortihm

The sliding window algorithm is a technique used for solving problems that involve finding a subset of data in a larger dataset that satisfies certain conditions. It works by defining a window of a fixed size that moves through the larger dataset one element at a time.

Here's a basic outline of how the sliding window algorithm works:

Initialize Variables: Set up variables to define the start and end of the window, and any other necessary variables for tracking the solution.
Expand the Window: Expand the window by moving the end of the window to the right until the current window satisfies the problem constraints or conditions.
Shrink the Window: Once the window satisfies the conditions, try to minimize it by moving the start of the window to the right while maintaining the validity of the solution.
Repeat: Continue steps 2 and 3 until you have traversed the entire dataset.

The sliding window algorithm is often used to optimize the time complexity of brute-force algorithms, particularly in problems involving strings, arrays, or sequences.
